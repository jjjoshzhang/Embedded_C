// printf outputs on ARM Cotext M3/M4/M7 or higher
// worksover SWO(serial Wire Output) pins of SWD interface

// serials means send data bit by bit

// Serial Wire Debug(SWD)

// program cannot communicate with SWD directly, use both IDE and debugger probe

// 2-wire protocol(CLK & IO), a connection method to debug MCUs
// ITM a built in feature used for store data in a buffer and send it to debugger,
// lets your program send debug data into the CPU’s debug system.

//SWO is a trace output pin used by ITM to send debug information to the debugger
//Traing means observing wat the cpu is doing while it runs without stoping it, sends observation data out of the chip

/* 
steps
	1.	Your code calls printf
	2.	Characters go into ITM
	3.	ITM sends them out through SWO
	4.	Debug probe receives them
	5.	IDE shows the text
